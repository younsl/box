# o

o stands for operation essentials. Production-ready Kubernetes tools, Helm charts, operational add-ons, and DevOps automation built with [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) 1.90+.

All applications in [kubernetes/](./box/kubernetes/), [tools/](./box/tools/), and [containers/](./box/containers/) are built with Rust 1.90+ (except `cocd` which uses Go). Rust provides key operational benefits: minimal container sizes, low memory footprint, single static binaries with no runtime dependencies, memory safety preventing null pointer and buffer overflow crashes, and compile-time guarantees ensuring system stability in production.
